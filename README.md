# .NET Engineer <br/> Assignment

Create an application which provides public address book (contacts) functionality.
## Technologies:
The app should be implemented using .NET (7.0) Web API and PostgreSQL
database.
The rest of the technologies required to implement a solution are your choice.
<br/>
## Features:
* contacts need to contain name, date of birth, address and multiple telephone numbers
* contacts need to be unique by name and address
* creating, updating and deleting contacts
* providing access to single and multiple contacts (with pagination)
<br/>
Keep in mind that the focus is on the backend and the client app is not a requirement. But any
additional feature can be added as long as the requested features from above are implemented.
You can provide the solution as a zipped file or as a git link.
